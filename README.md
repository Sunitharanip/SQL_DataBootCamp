SQL Querying for Data Analysis in SQL Workbench
Introduction
This document serves as a comprehensive guide to SQL querying for data analysis using SQL Workbench. SQL Workbench is a powerful tool for interacting with databases and performing various data manipulation tasks. This guide will cover essential SQL queries and techniques for conducting data analysis.

Prerequisites
Before diving into SQL querying, ensure you have the following:

SQL Workbench installed on your system.
Access to the database you want to analyze.
Querying Basics
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for retrieving and manipulating data stored in relational databases. Here are some fundamental SQL querying techniques:

SELECT Statement: Used to retrieve data from one or more tables.

1.SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
JOINs: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a relat

Basic Aggregations: Calculate sum, average, minimum, or maximum values.


2.SELECT SUM(column1), AVG(column2), MIN(column3), MAX(column4)
FROM table_name;
Filtering with WHERE: Filter data based on specific conditions.


3.SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column1 > value AND column2 = 'value';
Grouping and Aggregating: Group data and perform aggregations.


4.SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
Joining Tables: Combine data from multiple tables.

5.SELECT t1.column1, t2.column2
FROM table1 t1
INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
